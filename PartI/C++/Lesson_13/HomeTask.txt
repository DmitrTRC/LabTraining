1) Return the sum of all divisors of n, not including n

2) The format_address function separates out parts of the address string into new strings: house_number and street_name,
   and returns: "house number X on street named Y".
    The format of the input string is: numeric house number, followed by the street name which may contain numbers,
     but never by themselves, and could be several words long.
    For example, "123 Main Street", "1001 1st Ave", or "55 North Center Drive".

3) Use a map to count the frequency of letters in the input string.
   Only letters should be counted, not blank spaces, numbers, or punctuation.
   Upper case should be considered the same as lower case.
   For example, count_letters("This is a sentence.")
   should return {'t': 2, 'h': 1, 'i': 2, 's': 3, 'a': 1, 'e': 3, 'n': 2, 'c': 1}
